monokai-complete-syntax
=======================

A monokai theme for [Atom](https://atom.io/).

##Â Why yet another monokai theme ?

Most themes I found were not complete. I made sure in this implementation to adapt the theme for all (it's in progress) languages AND markdown preview.
To do so, I've copied the code from the theme [One-dark](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax) (hence the license) and updated the colors.

## What does it look like ?

## Installation

- Open a terminal
- Run `apm install monokai-complete-syntax`

- In _Themes_ choose _Monokai complete_ in the syntax theme drop-down
