monokai-complete-syntax
=======================

A monokai theme for [Atom](https://atom.io/).

##Â Why yet another monokai theme ?

Most themes I found were not complete. I made sure in this implementation to adapt the theme for all languages AND markdown preview.
To do so, I've copied the code from the theme [One-dark](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax) (hence the license) and updated the colors.

## What does it look like ? 

## Installation

Install linter and linter-raml:
- __Linter:__ If Linter is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter).
- __Linter-raml:__ run `apm install linter-raml`

## Configuration

You can configure this package by opening its settings view (`ctrl+,` then select the package) or by editing the entries below 'linter-raml' in _~/.atom/config.cson_.
